<li>
<p>Deep breathing: Relaxing your body can help sidestep a panic attack. Practice breathing in through your nose for a count of five, hold it for five and then breathe out through mouth for a count of five.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you suddenly feel your heart pounding or experience other physical clues that a panic attack is barreling for you, counting backward from 100 by 3s. The act of counting at random intervals helps you to focus and override the anxious thoughts that are trying to sneak into your psyche. Better still keep loose change in your pocket. Add a dime to a nickel, then add two pennies and so on. By controlling your thoughts and focusing on something outside yourself you will being to feel calmer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grounding yourself is another helpful technique. Tune yourself into 4 things around you that you can see, 3 things you can touch, 2 that you smell and 1 you can taste.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use ice packs to put two small ones in your hand and  2 large ones on your lower back. If your heart is really racing and your breathing is bad, take rub one of the ice packs from the middle of your chest down to the bottom of your belly, slowly, and over and over until your heart rate starts to mellow.</p>
