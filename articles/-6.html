<p>If you suspect that someone has a broken bone, provide first-aid treatment and help them get professional care:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stop any bleeding:</strong>  If they’re bleeding, elevate and apply pressure to the wound using a sterile bandage, a clean cloth, or a clean piece of clothing.</li>
<li><strong>Immobilize the injured area:</strong>  If you suspect they’ve broken a bone in their neck or back, help them stay as still as possible. If you suspect they’ve broken a bone in one of their limbs, immobilize the area using a splint or sling.</li>
<li><strong>Apply cold to the area:</strong>  Wrap an ice pack or bag of ice cubes in a piece of cloth and apply it to the injured area for up to 10 minutes at a time.</li>
<li><strong>Treat them for shock:</strong>  Help them get into a comfortable position, encourage them to rest, and reassure them. Cover them with a blanket or clothing to keep them warm.</li>
<li><strong>Get professional help:</strong>  Call 911 or help them get to the emergency department for professional care.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the person doesn’t appear to be breathing, is unconscious, or both, call 911 for medical help and begin CPR. You should also call 911 if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you suspect they’ve broken a bone in their head, neck, or back</li>
<li>the fractured bone has pushed through their skin</li>
<li>they’re bleeding heavily</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, help them get to the emergency department by car or other means so a doctor can diagnose their condition and recommend appropriate treatment.</p>
