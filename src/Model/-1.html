<li>Turn off the power at the main breaker in your house if the device is still plugged in. Wait for an electrician to check the device before using it.</li>
<li>If the power is out, use flashlights instead of candles.</li>
<li>If you have a CO detector and it starts beeping, leave your home right away and call 911.</li>
<li>Leave your home or building if you hear shifting or unusual noises. Strange noises could mean the building about to fall.</li>
<li>Watch out for fallen power lines that may be hanging overhead.</li>
<li>Throw away food that may have come in contact with flood or storm water. Unsafe food can make you sick even if it looks, smells, and tastes normal.</li>
